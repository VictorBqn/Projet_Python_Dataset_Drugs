# Projet_Python_Dataset_Drugs 
Analysis of a drug usage study on ~2000 persons around the world with varying ages, genders, and personnalities. 
we have to understand the dataset by de-normalizing it, then make visualisations to maybe highlight some correlations.
It is difficult to draw precise conclusions because of bias, the lack of diversity in the dataset (most of the people were white, from UK and America) so the results canâ€™t be perfectly concluentbut there are some interesting remarks, like te youth of drug users.
